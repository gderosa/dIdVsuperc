Differential conductance of superconductors.

Experimental data taken from Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS)
are fitted against the (modified) BCS model. Delta and Gamma parameters 
are found through chi-squared minization: Nelder-Mead "Simplex" and 
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms are used.

Developed during a Laboratory course at the University of Naples 
"Federico II", "Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche".

Thanks to the researchers Roberto Di Capua, Alessandro Gambardella and 
Marco Salluzzo, and to my fellow students Graziano Incalza and Tiziana Spina.
